                In our human-centric view, the ability to shoot ink or change colors may seem odd, but you know what’s really odd?
                Menopause.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                “It's incredibly rare trait in the natural world,” says Charli Grimes, an animal behaviorist at the University of Exeter
                in the United Kingdom. Only six animals—humans and five toothed-whale species—live past their reproductive years.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Orcas, or killer whales are one of those animals, and they have been studied extensively to learn why living past
                menopause is beneficial to their species. Research has shown a new power of menopause, which has often been portrayed in
                pop culture as a negative.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Grimes and her colleagues have identified a new way that these older females help the group: By protecting their sons
                from getting injured in fights with other orcas.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                (Why are these orcas killing sharks and removing their livers?)
                <br>
                <br>
                
                They did this by examining tooth-rake marks, scars from an opponent’s teeth going up the surface of the skin.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                This protection, however, is for sons only. Daughters and grandchildren need not apply.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                “That was really striking,” Grimes says, “to see that these females are just targeting the social support toward their
                male offspring.”

            <h2>What scars—and a half-century of data—reveal</h2>
            <p class="nd">
                The study, published in the journal Current Biology, focused on southern resident killer whales, an endangered
                population in the Pacific northwestern U.S. It was done by researchers from Exeter, the University of York, and the
                Center for Whale Research in Washington.
                <br>
                <br>
                Killer whales are apex predators and since this population are exclusively fish eaters, they wouldn’t be scarred by prey
                species.
                <br>
                <br>
                “We can say with certainty that these rakes come from within the population,” Grimes says. The rakes come from fighting,
                or possibly play that turns rough—but without seeing the interaction it’s hard to say for certain.
                <br>
                <br>
                (Vengeance—or playtime? Why orcas are coordinating attacks against sailboats.)
                <br>
                <br>
                “That's something we really want to explore further, using drones to observe this behavior directly,” Grimes says.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Center for Whale Research has been collecting information on this group of orcas for 47 years, and has almost 7,000
                photos of the 103 members of the population. The researchers know each orca so well they can identify them by the sight
                of their dorsal fins and the white pattern behind it, called a saddle patch.
                <br>
                <br>
                For this study, the scientists looked at the rake density—the number of pixels visible in photographs that were raked—of
                individual orcas. They found that males with post-reproductive mothers in the group showed fewer rake marks than males
                whose mother was still in her reproductive phase.
                <br>
                <br>
                There were no differences between the scars on males with a reproductive-age mother and no mother in the group.
                <br>
                <br>
                “That was a surprise,” says Deborah Giles, science and research director with the nonprofit Wild Orca, who was not
                involved in the study. “I would have expected it to be a mother, period.”
